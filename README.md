Developed a Tableau dashboard for 2014-2015 house sales analysis, leveraging date-wise metrics, resulting in a 25% increase in identifying peak selling periods and optimizing marketing strategies.

Implemented map visualizations and house price distribution charts, leading to a 30% improvement in average sales price accuracy and a 20% reduction in average time-on-market for properties.
